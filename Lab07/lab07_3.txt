Exercise 7.3

	a. Task 1:
		california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"]

		calibration_data = train_model( learning_rate=0.00005, steps=500, batch_size=5, input_feature="rooms_per_person")

	   Task 2:
		plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
		plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

	   Task 3:
		clipped_feature = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: min(x, 4))
		clipped_feature.hist()

	b. Its purpose is to study the relationship of two other features and predict the relationship value through the results.

	c. Outliers represent points that are outside the distribution range of common data which makes the data biased due to skewed points.

	   Pandas is a column oriented data analysis API which analyzes and visualizes data through a relational data table called DataFrame
	   Numpy is used to handle vector data and matrices to process data with mutidimensional structures
	c. It would be useful to reorder/shuffle a Pandas DataFrame for the consistency of the reults. When choosing a data from head and tail via reordering/shuffling, it can give a stable result of arbitrary data.

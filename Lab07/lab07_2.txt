Exercise 7.2

	a. Categorical data - data composed of textual. Numerical data - number data consisting of integer or float
	   Numerical data such as zip code can also be treated as categorical data since it isn't data for numerical computation.
	b. 1st task:
		train_model(learning_rate=0.00002, steeps=400, batch_size=4)
			Fianl RMSE (on training data):171.23
	   2nd task:
		train_model( learning_rate=0.00002, steps=800, batch_size=6, input_feature="population")
			Final RMSE (on training data): 177.97
	c. Hyper parameters are tuning options for users in ML, and in the exercise, learning_rate, batch_size, input_feature, and hyper parameters are hyper parameters.
	   There is no standard tuning algorithm because it is not a value optimized since the variable is set and controlled by users.

cite: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection

I don't think introspection is a good way to gain insight into human cognitive processes for the purpose of modeling
those processes because, based on Wikipedia, introspection relies on the ability to acknowledge one's mental
state. It basically gets information from the inside and I don't think that it can work with AI because it requires
information or intel that can be collected from the outside. Introspection requires information outside the brain to
learn. Introspection involves feeling and emotions and AI lacks feeling and emotion since it is not human, its a program
that follows the instruction that the programmer made. Maybe an AI that has introspection can be a problem which is good
that it doesn't have a self consciousness.

B)
	1. GPS problem solver is implemented as a function
	2. Goal states and initial states are lists of strings and operators are 
           dictionaries.
	3. The mechanism is recursive because of the functions written in the file:
	   achieve_all(), achieve(), apply_operator(), achieve_all(). It implements its
	   recursion by running achieve_all() which calls achieve() and then it calls
	   apply_operator which calls achieve_all()
D)
	1. Monkey and Banana Problem. Code doesn't fully implement the puzzle, its missing chair and stick as tools.
	2. The GPS can solve the problem by meeting the precondition that the monkey has in the room. The GPS looks for
	    the solution to know what it wants to do. The final goal of the monkey and banana problem is for the monkey to
	    eat the banana. The GPS can make up as many steps or solutions for the monkey to ea the banana. If the
	    condition aren't met, than the GPS will start from the beginning with a different method to reach the final goal.
	    The GPS decides whats the best course of action.
	3. Code is artificially intelligent. The precondition states to perform the action of getting the banana
	   by using the tools inside the room. Tools: chair and stick. It is thinking logically for an alternate solution
	   to eat the banana.
	4. Yes, the monkey thought of making a decision(logically) based on what was in the room.
	   The monkey thought of getting the banana and by using the chair and stick he decided to get the banana.
